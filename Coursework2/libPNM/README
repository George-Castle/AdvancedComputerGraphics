The code provided will serve as a base for your coursework in Advanced Graphics.
You can choose to implement your projects in either python or C/C++ at your convenience. For C/C++
code, you may use the Makefile provided to compile or write your own.
For python, first compile the library using one of the following commands based on your platform:
(Windows - Visual Studio) : nmake /F WINDOWS_MAKEFILE python
(Windows - mingw/g++)     : make --file UNIX_MAKEFILE python
(Unix - g++)              : make --file UNIX_MAKEFILE python

test that this works on your version of python 3 by running:
python main.py
and then import like any python package:
from PNM import *
The images once opened are stored in a numpy array. Tested and approved for python 2.7
